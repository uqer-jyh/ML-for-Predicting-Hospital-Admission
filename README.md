# ML-for-Predicting-Hospital-Admission

## Abstract

Machine learning solve the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is one of todayâ€™s most rapidly growing technical fields which standing at the intersection of computer science and statistics.

There are a number of issues in machine learning including how  to deal with imbalanced data, how to tune hyper-parameters, and how to do feature engineering.

In this report, we will predict whether an individual is admitted or not given their age, race, sex, the location where the injury occurred, body part affected, preliminary diagnoses and size of the care centre. We can solve these challenges by using SMOTE method to deal with imbalanced data and leveraging  Grid searching method to tune hyper-parameters. We would utilize the blending method to combine many powerful model to improve model performance. The average accuracy of blended model is 90.34%, and AUC score is 88.22%.
